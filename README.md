- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use locally stored fonts by using `@font-face`

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}
```

### Continued development

Improving at using semantic HTML tags and creating more accesible components
